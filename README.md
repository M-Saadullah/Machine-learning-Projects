# Machine-learning-Projects
I got Machine learning project "Human Activity Recognition"
I have sensor's data, collected by attaching various sensors to human body, after applying various Preprocessing techniques this data is refined and then Different Models are used Like
Naive Bayes for Binary Classification
Logistic Reggressiong for Binary Classificaion
Neural Network (Multiclass Classification) for 3 Activities
Neural Network (Multiclass Classification) for 5 Activities
